    "ReLU is also commonly used in deep learning due to faster convergence and non-saturating behavior.\n",

    "**Number of epochs** \n",
    "(1 Epoch means when the whole training data is passed forward and backward through the neural\n",
    "network only once) Refers to the total number of times the training data passes through the entire network. More epochs allow the model to learn better but increase the risk of overfitting if set too high. If too low, the model may underfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch size**\n",
    " Specifies the number of samples processed before updating the model’s parameters. Typical values are powers of two (e.g., 32, 64, 128).\n",
    " Larger batch sizes can speed up training and lead to smoother gradient estimates, while smaller batch sizes provide more generalization but increase training time and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of hidden layers**\n",
    " The number of hidden layers determines the depth of the neural network.\n",
    " More hidden layers allow the network to learn more complex representations but increase computational cost. Deep networks are better for complex problems, though they are more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of neurons at each hidden layer**\n",
    " Defines the width of each hidden layer, impacting the model's capacity.\n",
    "More neurons provide greater capacity to learn features but increase the risk of overfitting. If too few, the model may underfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Momentum term value**\n",
    "Helps accelerate gradient descent by adding a fraction of the previous gradient update to the current update. Common values range from 0.5 to 0.9. Increases convergence speed and helps the model escape shallow minima. A higher momentum can cause oscillations, while too low may slow down training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden layer activation function**\n",
    "Controls the non-linearity applied in hidden layers, similar to the activation function discussed above. However, the hidden layer activation function is often specifically optimized for deeper layers (e.g., ReLU).\n",
    "The activation function choice in hidden layers directly affects the network's ability to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization Parameter value**\n",
    "Regularization methods like L2 (weight decay), L1 regularization, or dropout require a parameter to control the extent of regularization. A high regularization parameter reduces overfitting by penalizing large weights or randomly dropping nodes. If set too high, it can cause underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning techniques\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **Manual Search** Run controlled experiemnts, where each experiment is a combination of hyperparameter values. Keep all but one parameter active, then analyze the effect and make your decision on which hyperparameter to change next, repeatng as necessary. Howeever, each experiment means training the model end-to-end, which is a very slow, especially for deep learning algorithms like CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Grid Search** systematically explores a defined grid of hyperparameters. The performance of the model on each combination of hyperparameters on a validation set is then evaluated. Hyperparameters resulting in teh best performance on the validation set are then chosen as the optimal hyperparameters. Model is trained on the training set w/ a specific set of hyperparameers, and the performance fo the model is evaluated on the validation set. This process is repeated for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, and the best performing combination is selected. It's an automated \"trial-and-error\" process to selecte hyperparameters for the most accurate model. \n",
    "\n",
    " **Bayesian Optimization** builds a probabilistic model of the function that maps hyperparameters to model performance and iteratively selects the most promising hyperparameters based on this model. More efficient than grid search; ideal for high-dimensional spaces and complex models. Complex to implement and computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Validation Grid Search** is an exhaustive search method where all possible combinations of specified hyperparameter values are evaluated using cross-validation. Each combination of hyperparameters is validated using a cross-validation approach, typically k-fold cross-validation, which splits the dataset into k subsets, training on k-1 of them and validating on the remaining one, rotating each subset as the validation set once. Computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    " **Random Search** randomly samples hyperparameter combinations instead of exhaustively searching all possible combinations. It defines a search space and randomly selects values for each hyperparameter within that space.Efficient for high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces since it doesn’t evaluate every combination. No guarantee of finding the absolute best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " **Bayesian Optimization** uses a probabilistic model to map hyperparameters to a performance measure based on past evaluations of the model. It iteratively updates its knowledge of hyperparameters and uses this model to decide which set of hyperparameters to evaluate next. Converges on a good solution faster than grid or random search, but complicated to implment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperband** is an adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping approach, based on principles of successive halving. Poorly performing configurations are halted early, making it faster than grid or random search since it doesn’t evaluate all configurations fully.\n",

    "Based on accuracy, the model with the parameters of {'activation': 'relu', 'dropout_rate': 0.2, 'momentum': 0.9, 'num_layers': 3, 'num_neurons': 64} is the best, with 0.962711 accuracy. However, it is only the second most consistent, with the  standard deviation of 0.007818. The most consistent model ekes it out with an accuracy std. of 0.007412 and an accuracy of 0.962153. Its parameters are {'activation': 'tanh', 'dropout_rate': 0.2, 'momentum': 0.9, 'num_layers': 3, 'num_neurons': 64}-- very similar, just with a differing activation function. The \"best model\" between these two depends on use case, as while both are very good, one is more accurate and the other is more consistent."
