    "- Part3) Assume you have completed 1 epoch of training. How do you compute the error of your model after completing 1 epoch on training and testing data (separately)? Provide a pseudocode to describe your algorithm for reporting the training and testing error after each epoch to investigate when the model converges (after how many epochs). \n",
