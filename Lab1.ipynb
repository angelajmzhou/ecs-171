    "Lab1: Complete the TODO parts in the following code. \n",
    "- Using California Housing Dataset from sklearn, select input attributes 1,3,4  as the input features. \n",
    "- Using K-fold cross validation technique (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html), complete the implementation to train a regression model and report performance merics when asked in the following code. \n",
    "- For multiple degrees of model complexity (i.e., degree of polynomial in this exercise) in a for-loop, obtain the model with the minimum reducible_error, polynomial degree, and run the obtained model on the test data. For this part,you should use the split the data into train and test by [75:25] rate and report mse of the final model on test data. \n",
    "- Analyse the results of model performance according to different degrees of polynomial and the number of folds used. You can manipulate the code and share your analysis in terms of the performance of the model (mse and total error), such as for instnace which degree of the model complexity (in relation to the polynomial order) would give a better model? Feel free to include other analysis about the generated models in relation to their performance results. You can event plot the results to support your analysis. "
