        "One interesting pattern I noticed with the default k-fold validation function settings was that the first split in each degree would have significantly higher variance and bias compared to the subsequent splits, exponentially so for the higher degrees. However, when I set the shuffle parameter to true, that problem went away, indicating that the first segment of data had a significant amount of outliers. Although shuffling the folds helped with the first fold, it resulted in higher error throughout the other folds because the outliers were now distributed more evenly. Thus, I set shuffle to false again to prevent the outliers from affecting the other folds (although EDA would typically prune those values). Analyzing these results, the best model (purely by the metric of MSE) was the polynomial model of degree 3 [0.667], followed closely by the model of degree 1 [0.614]. However, looking at the metric of total error (variance + bias squared) calculated from the test split results, the degree 1 polynomial model slightly edged out the degree 3 polynomial model for the top spot, with a total error of 2.0012 compared to 2.0615. These results indicate that the relationship between the input data and target values is on the simpler side, and adding more degrees would lead to overfitting. Although the total error is lower for the one-degree model, the bias squared is the same for both, meaning the average model prediction is about the same distance from the ground truth. The difference between the two total errors thus solely originates from the variance, which only provides information on model complexity and the variability of its predictions, which naturally increases as the model becomes more complicated. Therefore, since the difference in total error can solely be attributed to the higher complexity of the three-degree model, with little bearing on the actual reliability of the model, the lower MSE of the three-degree model in comparison to the one-degree model leads me to believe that it is the best polynomial model for this dataset.\n",
